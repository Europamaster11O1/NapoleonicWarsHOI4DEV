PLC_stanislaw_august_poniatowski:0 "Stanisław August Poniatowski"
PLC_stanislaw_august_poniatowski_desc:0 "Considered by many as a weak king, Stanisław August Poniatowski is a liberal ruler at heart. As a former lover of Catherine the Great he had been elected to the throne of Poland-Lithuania in 1764 in what was a de-facto coup, aided by thousands of Russian troops who had entered Poland to force this resolution through. \n\nDuring his reign the nation has become nothing more than a Russian protectorate and his powers have been significantly reduced by foreign intervention and internal opposition. He had attempted reforms, many of which fell through in the end. A portion of his reign had been dubbed the "King-Ambassador system of governance" due to the fact that the Russian ambassadors had used guarantee treaties signed with Poland-Lithuania to usurp de-facto power within the nation itself, governing from the Russian embassy. \n\nUnder the weakened King and increasingly corrupt aristocracy the nation had slipped into a sharp decline which climaxed in 1772 with the first partition of Poland. Ultimately the King had chosen to adapt to reforms spearheaded by the republicans, accepting the 3rd of May Constitution in 1791 and regaining a sizeable amount of power over state affairs."

PLC_treaty_of_perpetual_friendship_desc:0 "Imposed on Poland-Lithuania in 1768 by the Russian Empire, the treaty formalised Catherine the Great as the protector of noble rights within Poland-Lithuania. De-facto the treaty made Poland-Lithuania into a protectorate of the Russian Empire, justifying any Russian interventions in the case that the Poles might try and uplift the meddling of foreign affairs within their territory."
PLC_jurgielt:0 "Jurgielt"

PLC_jurgielt_desc:0 "Otherwise known as 'Jahrgelt', an institutionalised form of corruption that runs rampant within Polish politics.

In the past years the bribes paid out by the Russian embassy in particular have grown enormous and are now essentially a part of the fundamental system of politics in Poland. "

PLC_polish_prussian_pact:0 "Polish-Prussian Pact"
PLC_polish_prussian_pact_desc:0 "A treaty signed on the 29th of March, 1790, gave mutual guarantees between Poland-Lithuania and Prussia on the integrity of eachother's territory. Both nations agreed within the terms of the treaty to help eachother in case of an invasion by outside powers. Both nations would, by provisions of the treaty, raise forces of cavalrymen and infantrymen as an auxiliary corps to defend the other in case of such invasions. The treaty in it's form was meant to repel any further Russian interventions in Poland-Lithuania in order to cement the republican reforms occurring there."

PLC_third_may_constitution:0 "3rd of May Constitution"
PLC_third_may_constitution_desc:0 "Widely considered to be the first constitution of Europe and the second in the world (after the American constitution), the Constitution of the 3rd of May signed in 1791 is a fairly liberal document that grants a lot of liberties and rights to the citizens of Poland-Lithuania. The Constitution granted a large amount of powers to the King, alongside abolishing the liberum veto and the electoral system that had been in place for centuries. Though popular amongst the republican and liberal movements, the Constitution had found itself at odds with the upper nobility, which had lost many rights as a result of it's passing."
